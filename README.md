# Using MNsight

Tap anywhere on the map within Minnesota to get information about the soil, glacial geology, depth of the bedrock below the land's surface, and types and ages of the bedrock in that location. Press the 'under me now' button to instantly get the above information about your current GPS determined location.  Toggle the satellite and hillshade map views by pressing the button in the lower left. 

# About the data

**Elevation maps via MnTOPO**  
```[MnTOPO](http://dnr.state.mn.us/maps/mntopo/index.html) is a collaborative effort between staff from the Minnesota Information Technology (MN.IT) @ Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and MN.IT @ Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo). Funding was provided by the Clean Water Fund of the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment. The project is made possible by the [Minnesota elevation mapping project](http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/elevation/mn_elev_mapping.html). ``` 

**Subsurface information via MN DNR**  
```Data accessed using the DNR's [What's Under Your House?](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lands_minerals/webmaps/geomap.html) app.  
Original data from [Minnesota Geological Survey](http://www.mngs.umn.edu/) and the U.S. Dept. Of Agriculture compiled and generalized by the DNR.```
